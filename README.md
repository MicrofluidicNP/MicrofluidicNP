# Welcome to MicrofluidicNP

This is an open-source project aimed at enabling researchers to employ machine learning models to streamline the formulation development of nanomedicines. 
Currently, `mfNP` is the only deployed application, a Shiny application written in the R language, where users can upload data regarding the microfluidic production of nanoparticles. When a "critical mass" of data is reached, users can use that data to build machine learning models to provide microfluidic parameters and formulations that yield particles of a desired size, dispersity, and % encapsulation efficiency of some active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).
Future iterations may deploy other languages (e.g. python) to build the machine learning models.

Please visit the [mfNP](https://github.com/MicrofluidicNP/mfNP) project page to learn how you can employ this app for your own purposes.
